# Indic Compositionality Project

This project contains a collection of Python scripts for natural language processing tasks, specifically related to constituency parsing and the processing of parsed tree structures. The scripts are designed to work with data from the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) shared task.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in this project:

- `expand_trees.py`: Generates trigrams from bracketed constituency parses.
- `parse_wmt.py`: Parses one-sentence-per-line text files using the Benepar parser.

## Documentation

For more detailed information on each script, please refer to the following documentation files:

- [`expand_trees.py` Documentation](./expand_trees.md)
- [`parse_wmt.py` Documentation](./parse_wmt.md)
